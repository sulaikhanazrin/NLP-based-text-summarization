🧠 Accident Report Summarization using Named Entity Recognition (NER)
This project is a lightweight, real-time accident summarization tool built using spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) and custom regular expressions. It is designed to extract structured summaries from unstructured accident report paragraphs such as date, time, district, deaths, injuries, type of accident, and recommendation.

🔁 Background
Previously, a similar project was developed using LSTM + Regex-based summarization, hosted at:
🔗 NLP-based-text-summarization (GitHub)

While that model worked well, it was complex, training-heavy, and required more compute. Therefore, this new NER-based version is:

✅ Simpler and faster (no training required)
✅ Lightweight and easy to deploy
✅ Accurate for structured entity extraction
✅ Ideal for rule-based government data analytics
📌 Objective
Extract key accident information from unstructured text using spaCy NER and display it in a clean, structured format.
The extracted fields are:

District
Date
Time
Deaths
Grievous Injuries
Minor Injuries
Accident Type
Recommendation
🚀 Features
Accepts raw accident descriptions (paragraphs)
Uses spaCy's NER model (en_core_web_sm) for entity extraction
Custom regex rules for numeric fields (injuries, deaths, type)
Streamlit web interface for real-time usage
Example texts for easy testing
Outputs a clear summary instantly

🧪 Sample Inputs & Outputs
Example Input:

On 01 Dec 2021 at 05:30 PM, an accident occurred in THIRUVANANTHAPURAM CITY under the jurisdiction of Vattiyoorkavu police station. The accident type was Minor Injury. There were 0 fatalities, 0 grievous injuries, and 2 minor injuries. The accident took place at MOOTHAKUNNAM in a Rural area... Recommendation: Improve general road safety awareness and enforcement.

Generated Summary:

📍 District: THIRUVANANTHAPURAM CITY 📅 Date: 01 Dec 2021 ⏰ Time: 05:30 PM 💀 Deaths: 0 🚑 Grievous Injuries: 0 🩹 Minor Injuries: 2 📝 Type: Minor Injury ✅ Recommendation: Improve general road safety awareness and enforcement.
